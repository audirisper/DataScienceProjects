# DataScienceProjects
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

I used Python along with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to analyze the data, engineer features, and build predictive models. The goal was to classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and family size.

The project demonstrates my ability to clean and analyze real-world data, visualize insights, and apply classification algorithms to make data-driven predictions.
## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed missing data
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Engineered new features (e.g., family size, title extraction)
- Built and compared ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
